# computer-architectures-exercises

This are some of the excercises that are proposed from tutor and professor for the fall exams session at University of Rome, TorVergata.

>The course is named "Calcolatori elettronici" (Computer Architectures)
> 
## ./pre-course/
In this folder you can find some exercises that I tried to do before start the class.

- in [tested-standalone]() you can find some C files related to the exercises in [excercises_files]() folder.
Files inside this folder, are NOT developed in CLion, so with _Microsoft Visual Studio compiler_; I created them in Vim, they need to be compiled with _gcc compiler_
    #### Command Prompt
    ```sh
    gcc <path-to-file>/<file-name>.c -o <path-to-exe>/<exe-name>
    <path-to-exe>/<exe-name>.exe
    ```
    #### Vim (Normal mode)
    ```sh
    !gcc "%" -o <path-to-exe>/<exe-name>
    <path-to-exe>/<exe-name>.exe
    ```
- in [not-tested]() folder you can find same exercises, but without testing. They are developer with Microsoft Visual Studio Compiler. Just press "run" in CLion

## ./course/
